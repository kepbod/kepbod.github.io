- project: Circular RNAs
  description: Circular RNAs, as a newly emerging RNA species, have been identified in multiple species and different cell lines. But knowledge of their biogenesis machinery has remained limited. My work revealed some novel biogenesis clues for two distinct types of circular RNAs. One type of circular RNAs is derived from excised introns (circular intronic RNAs), and we discovered their processing depends on a consensus motif containing a 7 nt GU-rich element near the 5’ splice site and an 11 nt C-rich element close to the branchpoint site (Mol Cell, 2013). Another type of circular RNAs is from back-spliced exons (exonic circular RNAs), and we demonstrated that exon circularization is dependent on flanking intronic complementary sequences (e.g. IRAlus) and the efficiency of exon circularization can be regulated by competition between RNA pairing across flanking introns or within individual introns (Cell, 2014). We also depicted the complexity of alternative splicing of circRNAs (Genome Res, 2016) and pseudogenes derived from circRNAs (Cell Res, 2016).
